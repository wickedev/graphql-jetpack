![GraphQL Jetpack](assets/graphql-jetpack.svg)

A collection of packages for easily writing Kotlin GraphQL server implementations. Current major targets are [GraphQL Kotlin](https://opensource.expediagroup.com/graphql-kotlin/docs/), [Spring Webflux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html), and [Spring Data R2DBC](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-r2dbc).

# Getting Started

## Gradle

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://github.com/wickedev/graphql-jetpack/raw/deploy/maven-repo")
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.wickedev:graphql-jetpack-starter:0.4.6")
    implementation("io.github.wickedev:spring-data-graphql-r2dbc-starter:0.4.6")
}
```

## [Spring Data GraphQL](spring-data-graphql-r2dbc)

Spring Data GraphQL make easy to use [Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) with [graphql-java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java) implementations like [GraphQL Kotlin](https://opensource.expediagroup.com/graphql-kotlin/docs/), [DGS](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/). If you use [Spring Data R2DBC](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-r2dbc) or [Spring Data JDBC](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jdbc) directly, you have to write a lot of custom DataLoader. Spring Data GraphQL solves the N+1 problem through an internally auto-generated DataLoader.

In addition, it satisfies relay specifications such as Global Object Identification, Node, and Connection.

_â€» Currently, only spring-data-r2dbc is supported._

## [GraphQL Kotlin Spring Security](graphql-kotlin-spring-security)

Spring Security integration library with Custom GraphQL Directive `@auth`

## [GraphQL Kotlin Upload](graphql-kotlin-spring-webflux-upload)

[GraphQL Multipart Request Spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) implementation of [GraphQL Kotlin](https://opensource.expediagroup.com/graphql-kotlin/docs/).
